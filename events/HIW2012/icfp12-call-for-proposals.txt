          CALL FOR WORKSHOP AND CO-LOCATED EVENT PROPOSALS
                             ICFP 2012
 17th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming
                      September 9 - 15, 2012
                       Copenhagen, Denmark
               http://icfpconference.org/icfp2012/

The 17th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional
Programming will be held in Copenhagen, Denmark on September 9-15,
2012.  ICFP provides a forum for researchers and developers to hear
about the latest work on the design, implementations, principles, and
uses of functional programming.

Proposals are invited for workshops (and other co-located events, such
as tutorials) to be affiliated with ICFP 2012 and sponsored by
SIGPLAN.  These events should be more informal and focused than ICFP
itself, include sessions that enable interaction among the attendees,
and foster the exchange of new ideas.  The preference is for one-day
events, but other schedules can also be considered.

The workshops are scheduled to occur on September 9 (the day before
ICFP) and September 13-15 (the three days after ICFP).
