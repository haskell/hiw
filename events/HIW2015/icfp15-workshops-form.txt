NAME OF THE WORKSHOP:

   Haskell Implementors' Workshop

GOALS OF THE WORKSHOP:

  The Haskell implementors' workshop is a forum for those involved in
  implementing Haskell systems, infrastructure, libraries and tools,
  generally for people involved in implementing Haskell technology, to
  share their work and discuss future directions and collaborations
  with others.
  
  The scope in a bulleted list is:

  * Compilation techniques
  * Language features and extensions
  * Type system implementation
  * Concurrency and parallelism: language design and implementation
  * Performance, optimisation and benchmarking
  * Virtual machines and run-time systems
  * Libraries and Tools

  The workshop does not have proceedings. Talks are proposed by
  submitting an abstract, and selected by a small program committee.
  We intend the workshop to have an informal and interactive feel,
  with a flexible timetable and plenty of room for ad-hoc discussion,
  demos, and impromptu short talks.

  The workshop was held in conjunction with ICFP since 2009, and
  always featured both scheduled 30-minute talks and varying number of
  "lightning talks" contributed on the day.
  Aside from the core "implementors", it also attracts developers
  using Haskell in industry when they attend ICFP.

Why is there a need for this workshop?

  * The Haskell user community and language are growing rapidly.
    Implementations are becoming increasingly complex.  There is an
    acute need for a well supported tool chain for the deployment and
    configuration of Haskell software.  This workshop gives the
    language implementors and designers an opportunity to bat around
    ideas, share experiences, and ask for feedback from fellow experts.

  * The Haskell Workshop is now the Haskell Symposium, and as a result
    is no longer suitable for work-in-progress or pure implementation
    presentations. The focus of HIW is on those developers implementing
    the Haskell ecosystem itself, rather than using Haskell for other ends.

  * ICFP is the one time in the year when most of those working on
    Haskell infrastructure are together in the same place, so this is
    the ideal time to hold the workshop.  Most of the potential
    attendees will also want to attend the Haskell Symposium and ICFP.

NAMES OF POTENTIAL PROGRAM COMMITTEE MEMBERS, WITH AFFILIATIONS:

    This is a list of potential PC members. We aim to select five
    people plus the organiser to make a PC of six in total (while
    maintaining balance between academics and industrial members).

    Edward Kmett, 	S&P Capital IQ
    Christopher Brown, 	University of St.Andrews

    (Note that this list must be reviewed by SIGPLAN, which includes
    checking for broad representation.

      http://www.sigplan.org/DiversityPolicy.htm 

    Since SIGPLAN does sometimes request changes, PC invitations
    should wait until the workshop is approved.  Thus, you may
    wish to include alternate names, in case not all invitations
    are accepted.

    The ICFP Workshop Chairs will pass this proposed PC on to 
    SIGPLAN, and report back if there are any concerns.)


OTHER POTENTIAL ATTENDEES:

   (If desired; mainly for new workshops, as evidence of interest in
   the topic.)

PLANS FOR THE CALL FOR PAPERS / PARTICIPATION:

   There will be a CFP asking for potential speakers to submit a talk
   abstract, of similar length to a paper abstract, optionally with
   pointers to supporting materials.  The PC may also invite a
   number of speakers.  There will be a short online PC meeting to
   make the final programme selection.

   Calls for participation will be made in the usual way, using
   mailing lists, blogs, newsgroups and so on.

   Rough timeline:
    * CFP towards the end of May; a second CFP sent out at the end of June

    * deadline for contributions mid-July;

    * Online PC meeting shortly after the submission deadline;

    * notification to speakers towards the end of July
      (we aim to stay before the early registration deadline).

EXPECTED NUMBER OF ATTENDEES:

  Based on an average attendance over the last three years, we expect
  around 60 people to attend.
  Participants often choose to attend part of HIW while attending part
  of other workshops as well (workshops synchronise their schedules
  for this purpose).

PLANNED LENGTH OF THE WORKSHOP:

1 day

PLANS FOR PUBLICITY:

   Haskell mailing lists, blogs, newsgroups, web site, personal
   invitations.

PLANS FOR A PUBLISHED PROCEEDINGS:

   No proceedings.
   Abstracts and slides published on the workshop page (wiki, authors to 
   upload). Possibly talk videos published online with speakers' consent.

VIDEO RECORDING:

Video recording would be appreciated as availability of contributions
would otherwise reduce to putting abstract and slides online.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

   HIW should not run in parallel with the Haskell Symposium, as most
   HIW attendees will want to go to both.  Likewise, running in
   parallel with CUFP talks may be unfavourable.
   It can very well run in parallel with CUFP tutorials as these are
   aimed at new FP users which are largely disjoint from the HIW
   target audience.

   In the past, HIW was often run one day after the Haskell workshop,
   concurrently with CUFP Tutorials, which appears to suit the
   participants best.

SUBMISSION INFORMATION:

   The deadline for workshop proposals is NOVEMBER 16, 2014,
   and the completed form should be emailed to the ICFP 2015
   workshop co-chairs (Tom Schrijvers and Nicolas Wu),
   via email to icfp2015-workshops@cs.kuleuven.be.

   Authors of workshop proposals will be notified of acceptance
   or rejection by DECEMBER 15, 2014.

   PLEASE NOTE:
   Organizers should await SIGPLAN approval of the included program
   committee membership prior to sending out PC invitations.
