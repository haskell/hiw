How to Organise HIW
===================

0. Organising HIW is mostly sending emails to people and updating the website.
   The main responsibility is choosing a programme committee and coming up with a
   programme of speakers. What you don't need to worry about is booking the
   venue, interfacing with venue staff, or managing the money side of it. The ACM
   SIGPLAN people and ICFP workshops chair handles all of that. ACM SIGPLAN holds
   the money, decides on the cost of the workshop, and manages the registrations.


1. *Choose a co-chair.*

    Organising HIW is really a one person job, but it's good to have someone
    else in the loop, and to help choose programme committee members. Forward
    all emails to each co-chair, so if you break your leg doing something
    awesome then HIW can still continue.


2. *Read http://www.sigplan.org/sigplan_workshop_proposal.htm*

    The "Guidelines for General Chairs" and "Guidelines for Program Chairs" are
    particularly useful.


3. *Submit a workshop proposal.*

    The ICFP workshops chair will distribute a call for workshop proposals a
    month or two after the previous ICFP. This proposal describes what the
    workshop will be about, how many attendees are expected, and who might be
    on the PC. There are examples of previous proposals in the ~/events
    directory. Write up the workshop proposal and submit it to the workshops
    chair. Most of it can be copied from last year's proposal.


4.  *Select a programme committee.*

    When the workshop proposal is accepted, contact four people and ask them to
    be PC members. The PC is mostly to help review the talk proposals, but they
    can also have suggestions for running the event. You need to supply the
    names of potential PC members on the workshops proposal, but should only
    contact potential members after it has been accepted.

    The PC members should meet the SIGPLAN diversity policy
    http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Diversity/. Sadly, achieving
    gender diversity in the HIW programme committee can be difficult due to the
    lack of qualified female candidates. If this is the case then note it
    explicitly on the workshops proposal.


5.  *Write up the Call For Talks (CFT) announcement*, and discuss it with the PC.

    When choosing dates for proposal submission, notification etc, there are a
    few constraints:
    a) The HIW proposal deadline should be after Haskell Symposium
       notification. This is so people that get rejected from HS can still give a
       talk at HIW.
    b) Allow at least two weeks between HIW proposal submission and
       notification. The HIW PC will be spread out between timezones, so it takes
       a day for each 'round' in an email conversation.
    c) The HIW notification date should be before the ICFP online registration
       system opens. Ask the ICFP workshops chair when this will be. Most
       workshop attendees will decide whether to come to HIW based on the
       abstracts on the website. The full programme plus abstracts should be
       there before they need to decide.

6.  HIW usually has not invited speakers. We had one in 2018. There is no need
    to spend the budget; if unused, it it will be used for other ICFP purposes
    (e.g. PLMW).

    In 2011 we could give up to two invited speakers free registration
    to the workshop. This was done by supplying them with a "free registration
    code", obtained from the ICFP workshops chair. The speakers entered this
    code into the online registration system.

    If you don't have "invited speakers", the free registration codes can be
    given to speakers that submit regular talk proposals. In the past, the HIW
    PC has given free registration to PhD students that submitted good talk
    proposals but stated they were not sure if they could attend due to budget
    constraints. In effect, we "post invited" them. This looks good on the
    travel grant proposals that the students make to their universities.

7.  Spam the CFT to the usual channels, haskell-cafe, reddit, facebook,
    twitter, FP users group lists etc.

8.  Contact specific Haskell implementors you know might have a story to tell,
    and prod them to submit a talk proposal. You don't need to ask them to be
    "invited speakers", just ensure they submit a proposal.

9.  After the CFT deadline, collate all the proposals and mail them to the PC.

    If some proposals lack information then request more from the proposer.
    Some people have an interesting story to tell, but aren't good at writing
    proposals.

10. The PC (chairs included) reads the proposals, ranks them, and decides who
    will talk at the workshop.

    Having PC members provide a [-2..2] integer ranking for each proposal has
    worked well in the past.

11. Notify the potential speakers of the outcome.

12. Update the website with the full programme and abstracts.

    It is important to do this ASAP. Most workshop attendees will decide
    whether or not to come to HIW based on the programme and abstracts, so
    ideally it should be up before the online ICFP registration system opens.

13. Respond to the ICFP workshops chair when they ask when you want your tea
    breaks.

14. Ask the ICFP workshops chair what the copyright status of the videos will
    be.

    If ACM SIGPLAN videos the talks themselves then they own the copyright, and
    there can be trouble if someone posts them on youtube (or vimeo). There can
    also be trouble if a third party (such as a HIW attendee) videos the talks
    concurrently and posts their own videos online.

    However, if the local organisers record the videos, then SIGPLAN may only
    have a "right to redistribute". At HIW 2011, SIGPLAN had all speakers sign
    a form so that they could distribute the videos. We drew in a separate box
    that said "I also authorise these videos to be posted on public file
    sharing sites", and made sure to get a photocopy.

15. Attend the event, and delegate PC members (or other people) to chair each
    session.

16. Manage the lightning talks on the day.

17. Post links to the videos, and/or talk slides on the HIW website.

18. After the event, write up what you've learned and pass it onto the next chair.


FAQ
===

Q: Where to I get the budget information?
A: Ask the ICFP general chair for the previous year's workshop.
   Full budget information isn't known until after the event due to late registrations.
   ACM/SIGPLAN takes any left-over money to cover admin overhead.

Q: How should I decide when the deadline is?
A: In 2016 we eyeballed it based on the time until conference from last year.
   It would have been better if we a week earlier.  Ideally notifications
   would go out before the close of early registration, but when you are
   initially scheduling this date is usually not known.
