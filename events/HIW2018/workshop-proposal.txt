                        SEPTEMBER  23 - 29, 2018

                        WORKSHOP PROPOSAL FORM

----------------------------------------------------------------------


NAME OF THE WORKSHOP:

   Haskell Implementors' Workshop

GOALS OF THE WORKSHOP:

  The Haskell Implementors' Workshop is a forum for those involved in
  implementing Haskell systems, infrastructure, libraries and tools,
  generally for people involved in implementing Haskell technology, to
  share their work and discuss future directions and collaborations
  with others.

  The scope in a bulleted list is:

  * Compilation techniques
  * Language features and extensions
  * Type system implementation
  * Concurrency and parallelism: language design and implementation
  * Performance, optimisation and benchmarking
  * Virtual machines and run-time systems
  * Libraries and Tools

  The workshop does not have proceedings. Talks are proposed by
  submitting an abstract and selected by a small program committee.
  We intend the workshop to have an informal and interactive feel.

  The workshop was held in conjunction with ICFP since 2009, and
  always featured both scheduled 30-minute talks and varying number of
  "lightning talks" contributed on the day.
  Aside from the core "implementors", it also attracts developers
  using Haskell in industry when they attend ICFP.

OTHER POTENTIAL ATTENDEES:

   n/a

PLANS FOR THE CALL FOR PAPERS / PARTICIPATION:

   There will be a CFP asking for potential speakers to submit a talk
   abstract, of similar length to a paper abstract, optionally with
   pointers to supporting materials.  The PC may also invite a
   number of speakers.  There will be a short online PC meeting to
   make the final program selection.

   Calls for participation will be made in the usual way, using
   mailing lists, blogs, newsgroups and so on.

   Rough timeline:
    * CFP towards the end of May; a second CFP sent out at the end of June

    * deadline for contributions mid-July;

    * Online PC meeting shortly after the submission deadline;

    * notification to speakers towards the end of July
      (we aim to stay before the early registration deadline).


EXPECTED NUMBER OF ATTENDEES:

  Based on an average attendance over the last three years, we expect
  around 70 people to attend.
  Participants often choose to attend part of HIW while attending part
  of other workshops as well (workshops synchronise their schedules
  for this purpose).


PLANNED LENGTH OF THE WORKSHOP:

1 day

PLANS FOR PUBLICITY:

   Haskell mailing lists, blogs, newsgroups, web site, personal
   invitations.

PLANS FOR A PUBLISHED PROCEEDINGS:

   No proceedings.
   Abstracts and slides published on the workshop page (wiki, authors to
   upload). Possibly talk videos published online with speakers' consent.

WORKSHOP WEBSITE:

    http://conf.researchr.org/track/hiw-2018/hiw-2018

VIDEO RECORDING:

   Video recording would be appreciated as availability of contributions
   would otherwise reduce to putting abstract and slides online.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

   While I am aware of plans to reshuffle the ICFP-related workshops, to
   the best of my knowledge, they do not already affect 2018.
   Therefore, I hope we can go with the usual sequence
   ICFP - Haskell Symposium - HIW, and have HIW on September 29th

SUBMISSION INFORMATION:

   The deadline for workshop proposals is NOVEMBER 20, 2017,
   and the completed form should be emailed to the ICFP 2018
   workshop co-chairs (Christophe Scholliers and David Christiansen),
   via email to icfp-workshops-2018@googlegroups.com.

   Authors of workshop proposals will be notified of acceptance
   or rejection by DECEMBER 18, 2017.

   PLEASE NOTE:
   Organizers should await SIGPLAN approval of the included program
   committee membership prior to sending out PC invitations.
